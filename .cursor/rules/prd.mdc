# Basic Task Management API
### Requirements
Create a simple FastAPI application with in-memory storage for task management.

## API Endpoints to Implement
1. GET /tasks - Fetch all tasks
2. POST /tasks - Create a new task
3. PUT /tasks/{task_id} - Update an existing task
4. DELETE /tasks/{task_id} - Delete a task

## Basic UI
Create a simple web UI:

* Display all tasks in a list
* Form to create new tasks
* Buttons to mark tasks as complete/incomplete
* Delete buttons for each task
## Implementation Notes
* Use a simple Python list to store tasks in memory
* Generate task IDs using a counter or len() function
* Include proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 404)
* Add basic error handling for invalid task IDs# Basic Task Management API
